# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) 🎗️ dataset is a valuable resource for data science projects related to health and medicine:

* **Dataset Overview:**
  * The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, also known as the WBC dataset, is a classification dataset.
  * It records measurements from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses.
  * The primary task associated with this dataset is classification—specifically, predicting whether a breast cancer case is benign or malignant.
